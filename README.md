## About
This project serves as a "commit history" for Google Cloud's IAM catalog. It automatically tracks, diffs, and visualizes the addition and removal of GCP permissions over time, helping security researchers and cloud engineers spot new features or deprecations instantly.

It consumes data generated by [gcp-permissions-checker](https://github.com/exe-cut3/gcp-permissions-checker), which queries the official Google IAM API daily.

### Features

- **Provider-Level Tracking**: Tracks the entire catalog of ~12,000+ IAM permissions exposed by Google.
- **Historical Timeline**: Browse snapshots to see exactly when new services or permissions were introduced.
- **Deep Diffing**: See the exact difference in permission sets between any two dates.
